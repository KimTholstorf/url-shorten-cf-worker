# A URL Shortener created using Cloudflare Worker


## Getting started
### Create a Workers KV Namespace

This cloudflare worker stores generated urls in a workers key-value data store. Go to Workers KV and create a namespace and remember to choose a name that makes sence for your deployment. If you haven't already then this is also a great time to make shure your cloudflare workers subdomain is named something meaningfull and not something autogenerated. 

![worker-kv][worker-kv]

### Create a new Worker
Create a new Worker (service). Just like with the KV Namespace, you should change the Worker name to someting meaningfull instead of the default generated name. You can choose either if the sugested starter options as it doesn't matter.

![worker][worker]

#### Bind the KV Namespace to the Worker 

In Worker Settings -> Variables add a `LINKS` variable that points your KV namespace. This variable is used in `index.js` to reference the KV Namespace and must be named so, unless you plan to make changes to the code in `index.js`.

### Copy the code in `index.js` to your own Cloudflare Worker 

Copy the `index.js` code from this project to Cloudflare Worker. Copy and Paste works fine.

![worker-code][worker-code]

### Save and Deploy

Click Save and Deploy.

### [optional] Create HTTP Route to worker

If you have Cloudflare as your DNS server for a domain you want to use for this Worker, then create a  cloudflare proxied AAAA "DNS-dummy" record pointing to `100::`.
Then in Worker Settings under Trigger, create a HTTP Route to this Worker - i.e. example.com/*
If you don't have Cloudflare DNS for your domain, then you can always access your worker on https://[worker-name].[worker-subdomain].worker.dev and make CNAME records or URL forwards to this domain.
